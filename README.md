# IMDB-Parsing
Web scraping program that asks the user for movie specifications of the IMDB top 250 rated movies and prints a neat table.

To run the program:
- Ensure you have the ```Beautiful Soup```, ```pandas```, ```re```, and ```requests``` Python modules installed.
- Ensure you have python 2 or 3 installed
- Run ```python[x] imdb.py```, where ```x``` can either be ```""``` (nothing) or ```3``` (for python 3)
- Enjoy!
